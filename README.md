# Escape
*My first game in Python... Remastered*

## How to run
Currently only supports Windows. Using other OS's might bring unsuspecting errors.

*Recommended*: Use Python's [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), create a virtual environment in the root directory, then install the requirements through pip

Once the requirements are met, run the game with `python Escape.py`
